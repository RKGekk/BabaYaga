// Supplies a mechanism to enable matrices to be pushed onto and popped off of a matrix stack.
// Implementing a matrix stack is an efficient way to track matrices while traversing a transform hierarchy.
// Matrix stack to store transformations as matrices.
// Implementing a Scene Hierarchy
// A matrix stack simplifies the construction of hierarchical models, in which complicated objects are
// constructed from a series of simpler objects.
// A scene, or transform, hierarchy is usually represented by a tree data structure.Each node in the tree
// data structure contains a matrix.A particular matrix represents the change in coordinate systems from
// the node's parent to the node. For example, if you are modeling a human arm, you might implement the following hierarchy.
// In this hierarchy, the Body matrix places the body in the world.The UpperArm matrix contains the rotation
// of the shoulder, the LowerArm matrix contains the rotation of the elbow, and the Hand matrix contains
// the rotation of the wrist.To determine where the hand is relative to the world, you simply multiply
// all the matrices from Body down through Hand together.
// The previous hierarchy is overly simplistic, because each node has only one child.If you begin to model
// the hand in more detail, you will probably add fingersand a thumb. Each digit can be added to the
// hierarchy as children of Hand.
// If you traverse the complete graph of the arm in depth - first order-traversing as far down one path
// as possible before moving on to the next path—to draw the scene, you perform a sequence of segmented
// rendering.For example, to render the handand fingers, you implement the following pattern.
// 1.  Push the Hand matrix onto the matrix stack.
// 2.  Draw the hand.
// 3.  Push the Thumb matrix onto the matrix stack.
// 4.  Draw the thumb.
// 5.  Pop the Thumb matrix off the stack.
// 6.  Push the Finger 1 matrix onto the matrix stack.
// 7.  Draw the first finger.
// 8.  Pop the Finger 1 matrix off the stack.
// 9.  Push the Finger 2 matrix onto the matrix stack.You continue in this manner until all the fingersand thumb are rendered.
// After you have completed rendering the fingers, you would pop the Hand matrix off the stack.
// You can follow this basic process in code with the following examples.When you encounter a node
// during the depth - first search of the tree data structure, push the matrix onto the top of the matrix stack.
// MatrixStack->Push();
// MatrixStack->MultMatrix(pNode->matrix);
// When you are finished with a node, pop the matrix off the top of the matrix stack.
// MatrixStack->Pop();
// In this way, the matrix on the top of the stack always represents the world - transform of the current
// node.Therefore, before drawing each node, you should set matrix.
